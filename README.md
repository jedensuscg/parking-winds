Small app designed to show forecasted winds and and temperature at various US Coast Guard airstations, and displays the information on a map of the units aircraft parking ramp. Data helps to determine best parking orientation for aircraft to avoid damaging winds from hitting the aircraft from the wrong angles throughout the forecast period.

includes high wind warning, arrows, and other visual cues to assist.

My goal for this app was to learn a broad range of technologies needed to design, test and run a web app, including the the following:
- Learned NodeJS
- Refactored the backend from callbacks to promises.
- Learned basic MongoDB
- FLearned how to use VUE on the front-end
- Brushed up on my CSS and HTML knowledge
- App is hosted on a virtual private server fully managed by me, but hosted on digital ocean
- Learned how to setup an Nginx server
- Learned how to route subdomains to specific apps on VPS
- Learned how create logs and monitor the APP using PM2
- Exenstive learning of SSH tunneling to remotley manage the VPS
- And a LOT of troubleshooting along the way.
