<h4> Welcome to Version 2 of Parking Winds Visualizer. This version is currently in production and features are still being added.</h4>
    <h4> This page is phase 1 of the PWV, focusing on a complete front end remake using a dynamic map instead of premade images. As such, only information present
    on the original page is present here, until Phase 2 starts, which is a overhaul of the backend server to add more features.

    <h1 style="color: red">SITE BACK UP</h1>
    <h2>The new backend rework is complete. I switched from pulling from aviationweather.gov in XML format to JSON, which which allowed for some streamlining of the code in the end.</h2>
    All wind data is obtained from AviationWeather.gov's <a href="https://aviationweather.gov/data/api/">Data API</a>. Temperature information is obtained
    from <a href="https://www.tomorrow.io/">Tomorrow.io API v4 </a> with limited usage plan of 500 requests per day.
    <ul>

        <h5>Change Log</h5>
        <li>
            Reworked backend to pull data directly in JSON format, rather then XML and then converting to JSON for use with the front end.
            Added Alerts to right side of screen. Current alerts are for Freeze Warning (<34 degrees F), high wind CAUTION (>22kts) and high wind                 WARNING(>34kts)
            Added Lowest Temperature to the sidebar, plus when opening the sidebar shows current METAR temp and the time the lowest temp starts.
            Moved most of the information to a sidebar to reduce clutter on the main page
            Wind Icon: Buttons to select wind data.
            Text Icon: METAR and TAF data.
            Airplane Icon: Unit selection.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added some basic mobile responsiveness. The sidebar will start collapsed on smaller screens
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>BUG FIX:</b> Fixed alerts not being removed when switching units
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>KNOWN ISSUE:</b> The strongest winds field not showing gusts, even if gusts and are unable to be selected. However High Wind Alerts ARE 
            being shown for gusts speeds. If a wind of >22 kts alert is shown, but strongest winds show <22kts, it is probably the wind gusts causing 
            the alert. A big is being implemented when a UI update for selecting winds is finished.
            <br>
            --<b>WORKAROUND:</b> The METAR and TAF data is always the most accurate information, see the decoded METAR/TAF lines for details.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>KNOWN ISSUE:</b> The current temp is not displaying. This is due to the way the temperature API works and requires a second query to their servers.
            <br>
            --<b>WORKAROUND:</b> None at this time. I already have the current METAR temp available for use. It is not "current" so could be an hour old. I just need to program it into the display.
        </li>

    <li>
        <h5 class="bi bi-caret-right-fill">CURRENT WORKING FEATURES</h5></i>
    </li>
    <li>Street and Satellite Maps available</li>
    <li>Full TAF and METAR data available</li>
    <li>Toggle between current winds, current gusts, the most prevelant wind and the highest forcasted gusts in the next 24 hours</li>
    <li>Replaced arrows with wind barbs. A quick refresher on wind barbs:
        <ul>
            <li>Winds are coming from the direction of the barbs, TOWARDS the center of the aircraft. Imagine the line is an arrow and the barbs are the feathers</li>
            <li>Each long barb represents 10 knots</li>
            <li>Each short barb represents 5 knots</li>
            <li>Each triangle represents 50 knots</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>IN DEVELOPMENT FEATURES FROM VERSION 1.0</h5>
    </li>
    <li>Recreating the information panel to include time periods of expected wind catagories</li>
    <li>Incorporating temperature</li>
    <li>Wind and Temperature warnings</li>
    <li>
        <h5>UPCOMING FEATURES</h5>
        Thanks to the new dynamic map, I can now add more features that were not possible in the original version. These include:
    </li>
    <li> Easier incorporation of new units through an on map system to point and click on parking spots and add to the database.</li>
    <li> Realtime weather over-layed over the map</li>
    <li> More customization</li>

    </ul>
