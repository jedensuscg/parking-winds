<h4> Welcome to Version 2 of Parking Winds Visualizer. This version is currently in production and features are still being added.</h4>
    <h4> This page is phase 1 of the PWV, focusing on a complete front end remake using a dynamic map instead of premade images. As such, only information present
    on the original page is present here, until Phase 2 starts, which is a overhaul of the backend server to add more features.

    <h1 style="color: red">SITE CURRENTLY DOWN</h1>
    <h2>Due to a change in aviationweather.gov's API, data is not being retrieved from the site. Until I have time to change the code to account for the new API the website is not functional</h2>
    All wind data is obtained from AviationWeather.gov's <a href="https://aviationweather.gov/data/api/">Data API</a>. Temperature information is obtained
    from <a href="https://www.tomorrow.io/">Tomorrow.io API v4 </a> with limited usage plan of 500 requests per day.
    <ul>

        <h5>Change Log</h5>
        <li>
            Added Alerts to right side of screen. Current alerts are for Freeze Warning (<34 degrees F), high wind CAUTION (>22kts) and high wind                 WARNING(>34kts)
            Added Lowest Temperature to the sidebar, plus when opening the sidebar shows current METAR temp and the time the lowest temp starts.
            Moved most of the information to a sidebar to reduce clutter on the main page
            Wind Icon: Buttons to select wind data.
            Text Icon: METAR and TAF data.
            Airplane Icon: Unit selection.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added some basic mobile responsiveness. The sidebar will start collapsed on smaller screens
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>BUG FIX:</b> Fixed alerts not being removed when switching units
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>KNOWN ISSUES:</b> The strongest winds field not showing gusts, even if gusts and are unable to be selected. However High Wind Alerts ARE 
            being shown for gusts speeds. If a wind of >22 kts alert is shown, but strongest winds show <22kts, it is probably the wind gusts causing 
            the alert. A big is being implemented when a UI update for selecting winds is finished.
            <br>
            --<b>WORKAROUND:</b> The METAR and TAF data is always the most accurate information, see the decoded METAR/TAF lines for details.
        </li>

    <li>
        <h5 class="bi bi-caret-right-fill">CURRENT WORKING FEATURES</h5></i>
    </li>
    <li>Street and Satellite Maps available</li>
    <li>Full TAF and METAR data available</li>
    <li>Toggle between current winds, current gusts, the most prevelant wind and the highest forcasted gusts in the next 24 hours</li>
    <li>Replaced arrows with wind barbs. A quick refresher on wind barbs:
        <ul>
            <li>Winds are coming from the direction of the barbs, TOWARDS the center of the aircraft. Imagine the line is an arrow and the barbs are the feathers</li>
            <li>Each long barb represents 10 knots</li>
            <li>Each short barb represents 5 knots</li>
            <li>Each triangle represents 50 knots</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>IN DEVELOPMENT FEATURES FROM VERSION 1.0</h5>
    </li>
    <li>Recreating the information panel to include time periods of expected wind catagories</li>
    <li>Incorporating temperature</li>
    <li>Wind and Temperature warnings</li>
    <li>
        <h5>UPCOMING FEATURES</h5>
        Thanks to the new dynamic map, I can now add more features that were not possible in the original version. These include:
    </li>
    <li> Easier incorporation of new units through an on map system to point and click on parking spots and add to the database.</li>
    <li> Realtime weather over-layed over the map</li>
    <li> More customization</li>

    </ul>
